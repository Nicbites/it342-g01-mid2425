### **Eighth Entry**
**What I learned today:**  
We took a quiz on **functional and non-functional requirements**. I reviewed how functional requirements describe *what* the system should do (e.g., login, transactions), while non-functional requirements describe *how* the system performs (e.g., performance, security).

**What I'm still confused about:**  
How to clearly categorize borderline cases—some requirements feel like they fit both categories.
